# DEXICON - project 1

## About

This is our Project-1! Our application is a word-play game that helps users expand their vocabulary or test their knowledge on the definitions of words.

Motivation: We came up with this idea because we wanted to provide users with a fun, interactive way to test their vocabulary knowledge.

Results: Using the Words API and Meriam Webster API, users receive a randomly generated definition and then from there, they are to choose the word that matches the definition. We utilized a Firebase database so that users can create an account and login to track their progress via their score.

Challenges: Our initial challenge was how to utilize our chosen APIâ€™s to generate a random word list for us to pull from. We first decided to use the Meriam Webster API, but later realized we could use the Words API to generate our random word array and could then utilize the Meriam Webster API to include the word definitions. We also faced numerous challenges using our Github repo - specifically, the best practices for how to push/pull without creating conflicts or breaking the working code we had.
